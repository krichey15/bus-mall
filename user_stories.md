**Marketing Research Team**

 - We would like to find out which items are most enjoyed.
 - We would like to display those products in our catalog.
 - We would like to the stats to build up over multiple users.

**Users**

 - As a user I want to have a very self explanatory survey.
 - As a user I want to be able to see what other people have chosen.
 - As a user I would prefer not see the same item all the time.
 - As a user I would like something visually appealing.

**Developer**

 - As a developer I only want to display 3 images at a time.
 - As a developer I want to make sure results are only displayed after 25 clicks.
 - As a developer I want to keep track of how popular the images are.
 - As a developer I want to keep track of how many times the image shows up.
